# Angular Workspace

This is my Angular workspace.  
It is intended to hold all my personal projects (apps and libs) built with Angular.

The root application (located in the `src/` folder) is a **reference application**
which provide a set of usage examples for each projects.
Its main purpose is to serve as a kind of reference documentation for this workspace.

All projects are located in the `projects/` folder.
